## 🧮 Cost Over Time Analysis

### Year 1 Costs

**Colab-Only Approach:**
- Hardware: $160 (Pi + camera)
- Colab Pro: $120/year ($10/mo)
- **Total Year 1**: $280

**Local GPU Approach:**
- Hardware: $380 (Pi + camera + RTX 2060)
- Electricity: ~$50/year (training 10hr/week)
- **Total Year 1**: $430

**Break-even: ~15 months** (Colab Pro vs local GPU)

**But consider:**
- Local GPU: Unlimited training, no session limits
- Colab Pro: No upfront cost, reliable access to latest GPUs
- Local GPU: Resale value (~$150 after 2 years)

## 💡 Money-Saving Tips

### 1. Buy Used GPUs
- eBay, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace
- Check seller reputation
- Test before buying (run benchmarks)
- Aim for RTX 2000/3000 series (good VRAM/price)

### 2. Reuse Existing Hardware
- Old gaming PC? Add a used GPU
- Have a laptop? Use Colab for training
- Existing Raspberry Pi 4? Start there (upgrade to Pi 5 later)

### 3. Start Small
- Train on Colab (free)
- Deploy on Pi 5 CPU (slow but functional)
- Upgrade accelerator when budget allows

### 4. Share Resources
- Training PC can serve multiple robots
- One OAK-D can be swapped between test robots
- Co-working space GPU (if available)

### 5. Consider Alternatives
- **RoboFlow hosted training**: $0-50/mo (no local GPU needed)
- **Google Cloud / AWS**: Pay per use (~$0.50-2.00/hr for GPU)
- **University resources**: Free compute if you're a student

## 🤔 Decision Tree

```
Do you have any existing hardware?
├─ Yes, gaming PC with PCIe slot
│  └─ Buy used RTX 3060 ($350) → Train locally
├─ Yes, any computer
│  └─ Buy OAK-D Lite ($149) → Train on Colab
└─ No, starting from scratch
   └─ Buy Pi 5 + camera ($105) → Train on Colab
      └─ Later: Add Hailo-8 ($70) OR OAK-D ($149)

## ✅ My Recommendation

**For most people starting out:**

**Phase 1: Learn ($160)**
- Pi 5 + Pi Camera
- Google Colab Free
- Deploy at 5-8 FPS (acceptable for learning)

**Phase 2: Make it Real ($+150)**
- Add Hailo-8 AI Hat → 25 FPS
- OR Add OAK-D Lite → 15 FPS + depth + better camera

**Phase 3: Scale ($+350)**
- Buy used RTX 3060 12GB
- Now you can: Train large models, multiple robots, fast iteration

**Total over 6-12 months: $660**

This gets you:
- Complete training pipeline
- Real-time inference (25-30 FPS)
- Depth sensing (if OAK-D path)
- Multi-class detection
- Segmentation capable
- Professional results
